# Vehicle Fuel Efficiency Analysis (2014-2024)

This repository contains a comprehensive dataset and analytical scripts for studying factors influencing fuel efficiency in vehicles over the period from 2014 to 2024. The goal of this case study is to systematically analyze and identify actionable solutions for improving fuel economy.

## Key Objectives
- **Evaluate Trends in Fuel Efficiency**: Analyze how the average fuel efficiency (MPG) has changed from 2014 to 2024 across different vehicle types (sedans, SUVs, trucks).
- **Correlation Analysis**: Investigate the correlation between engine size (displacement), number of cylinders, and fuel efficiency (MPG) for vehicles manufactured between 2014 and 2024.
- **Impact of Alternative Fuel Technologies**: Assess the influence of advancements in alternative fuel technologies (electric, hybrid) on overall fuel efficiency and emissions reduction over the past decade.
- **CO2 Emissions Trends**: Identify trends in CO2 emissions per mile (tailpipe emissions) of vehicles from 2014 to 2024, and determine the factors contributing to the highest and lowest emissions.
- **Manufacturer Performance**: Examine which vehicle manufacturers have consistently produced the most fuel-efficient vehicles and the design features or technologies that have driven their performance.

## Dataset
The dataset includes detailed information on vehicle specifications, fuel consumption, emissions, and more, for vehicles manufactured between 2014 and 2024.

### Data Source
The data for this study is sourced from [www.fueleconomy.gov](https://www.fueleconomy.gov).
